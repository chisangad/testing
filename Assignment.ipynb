The data set to be used in the assignment has been provided for you on Moodle, the data is based on real-life data from a national insurance company called KAT insurance with operations in the USA. The data set contains more than 65,000 insurance sales records from 2017. All data and names have been anonymised to preserve privacy. You will first have to find and correct errors in the data set.\n",
